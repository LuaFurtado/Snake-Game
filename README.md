# 🐍 **Snake Game**

This repository contains my first JavaScript game: a classic **Snake Game** built using the **HTML Canvas** element.

I’m creating this project as part of my **Techtonica software engineering journey**.  

I first looked at JavaScript for Kids to understand the basics, but I soon realized the book used jQuery and didn’t include some features I wanted, like letting the snake pass through walls. From there, I pieced the game together using YouTube tutorials, a lot of reading, other books, documentation, and support from my mentor.
