🐍 Snake Game

This repository contains my first JavaScript game: a classic Snake Game built using the HTML Canvas element.

I’m creating this project as part of my Techtonica software engineering journey. The idea and initial structure were inspired by the book JavaScript for Kids, which introduces fun ways to explore programming, game logic, and canvas rendering.

My goals with this project include:

Practicing JavaScript through hands-on development

Learning how to draw and animate using Canvas

Working with movement, key events, and game loops

Understanding how to structure a small interactive project

Iterating and improving the game as I continue learning

More updates will be added as the game evolves.
