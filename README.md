# 🐍 **Snake Game**

This repository contains my first JavaScript game: a classic **Snake Game** built using the **HTML Canvas** element.

I’m creating this project as part of my **Techtonica software engineering journey**.  
The idea and initial structure were inspired by the book _**JavaScript for Kids**_, which introduces fun ways to explore programming, game logic, and canvas rendering.

## 🎯 **Project Goals**

- **Practice JavaScript** through hands-on development  
- **Learn how to draw and animate** using Canvas  
- Work with **movement, key events, and game loops**  
- Understand how to **structure a small interactive project**  
- **Iterate and improve** the game as I continue learning
